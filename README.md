# RPG-Game-1

Just an old Game-Maker legacy project I worked on for a while. I don't have Game-Maker anymore,
but most of the files are in an XML-like format and the information and spirit of the code
could be ported to a different engine. I'm not sure I care enough to fix what's here though
instead of just starting fresh, because there's really not enough here for me to justify the
effort. 


## Features include:

#### A player with functional WASD controls, an attack button or two, and multiple spell types, including:

a flamethrower attack, which just throws fire in a cone towards the mouse;

an ice attack, which fires a single ice ball which then explodes in an icy cloud;

an electric attack, which fires in a beam toward the mouse; and

a 'healing' spell which really does nothing but make some fancy sprites come up.


    
#### There are 3 distinct enemy types: 

one which homes in on the player if they're close enough,

one which runs away from the player by the same metric, and

one with pathfinding ability which follows the player around obstacles.

#### There's also

LOTS of altered pictures of koalas, my favorite of the stock pictures at the time,

a super basic testing map,

and some other stuff that I don't want to figure out.
